The BCCP-Peking University Summer Student Visitor program aims to connect best undergraduate students of physics from Peking University with the research activities at the Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP). BCCP is part of the physics department of the University of California, Berkeley. The center aims to understand the origin and evolution of the universe through a series of programs to define the observations, experiments, concepts, and simulations needed to answer the fundamental questions in cosmology.

The visitor program hosts up to 3 visiting students each summer (dates are flexible) on the UC Berkeley main campus. We also encourage longer stays, such as one semester and a summer if appropriate arrangements on course work can be made. Advanced researcher (postdoc or above) will mentor the academic research of the student after acceptance. Funding may be available to partially or fully cover the living and visa expenses, depending on the student needs and availability of funding.
