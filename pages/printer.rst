We have a Color printer located in NCH 341.

To use the printer you must be connected to Eduroam, AirBears2,
or wired network in 341.

If your connection is wired to another instituion via VPN, the printer won't work.

(Add `.` to the address to make it proper)

There is a web server on the ``https://`` port.
Add a CA exception to the browser in order to visit it.

To add the printer to your computer, 
type in the host name into
Windows / Linux / OSX's printer management wizard;
usually in the 'address' or 'hostname' field.

If no driver is suggested, use ``Generic Postscript Printer``.

If you find issues setting up the printer, talk to Yu Feng.
