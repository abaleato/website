**Postdoctoral Fellow--Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP) and Theoretical Astrophysics Center (TAC)**

The Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP) and Theoretical Astrophysics Center (TAC) at the University of California, Berkeley, invites applications for BCCP and TAC Postdoctoral Fellows, with an anticipated start date in summer or fall 2021. BCCP Fellows are expected to carry out independent research on topics of their choosing in cosmology. TAC Fellows can pursue research in any area of theoretical astrophysics.  Fellows positions will be for two years with the possibility of a one-year extension. Applicants responding to this ad will be considered for both the BCCP and TAC Fellowships, and will also be considered for grant-supported postdoctoral positions with BCCP and TAC members.

The Fellows will have the opportunity to interact and work with the broad spectrum of theoretical astrophysics and cosmology researchers in the Berkeley Astronomy and Physics Departments, and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The experimental and observational programs at Berkeley include supernovae, black holes, extra-galactic astronomy, galaxy clustering, weak lensing and cosmic microwave background, and multi-messenger astrophysics including gravity waves, in addition to a broad theoretical astrophysics and cosmology research program. The Fellows will also find a rich data-science environment at UC Berkeley and LBNL, with world-expert researchers in both computer science/statistics and domain science aspects of this emerging field. Information on the BCCP's current activities and membership may be found at the BCCP's website: bccp.berkeley.edu. 

Basic qualifications:  All Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree requirements except the dissertation at the time of application. 

Additional qualifications: Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree by the start date.

Salary range: $60,000-$70,000
